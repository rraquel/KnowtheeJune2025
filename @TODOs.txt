This is a list of things to do and not forget

Add backend services in docker yml file to handle interference logiv and serves chat
separate dev and prod  in docker configurations separate yml files with optimized settings
add reverse proxy ? if we are going for a multi container approach
Hardcoded API URL: Switch to environment variables or config.py for backend URLs.
    import os
    BACKEND_URL = os.getenv("BACKEND_URL", "http://localhost:8000/api/talent")

Database:
full text search indexes for resume dields 
store token counts and labels per chunk in embedding_chunks for optimization
ensure foreign key constraints between assessments and employee indexes
Test chunking and embedding methods

Backend:
Hardcoded API URL: Switch to environment variables or config.py for backend URLs.
    import os
    BACKEND_URL = os.getenv("BACKEND_URL", "http://localhost:8000/api/talent")

Add timeout=5 and try/except for robustness. Consider backoff logic for unstable production setups.

Session memory is volatile:
    Replace in-memory session_memory with Redis or a database-backed session store.
    Allows persistence, scaling, and multi-user production use.

Lazy loading is fine, but no concurrency control:
    Protect RAG system instantiation with a thread lock or use dependency injection frameworks if moving to async/multiprocess environments.

Logging is enabled, but likely missing structured tracing:
    Add user ID, timestamps, and query IDs to logs.
    Consider a logging framework like structlog or integrations with observability platforms (e.g., Sentry, Datadog).
Testing and rate limiting:
    No API authentication or user verification (not critical in MVP but needed before going to production).
    Add rate limiting to prevent abuse.
